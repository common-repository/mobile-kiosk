Drive a mobile slideshow style kiosk from your Wordpress site.

== Description ==

With Mobile Kiosk, you can easily create great looking full page slide shows straight from your Wordpress site. Instead of using boring static signage, show off your brand with an exciting dynamic display. Mobile Kiosk works great on both tablets and large screen TVs.

**Using on a Tablet**
Tablets are great for small desktop displays, or as a part of a larger display that needs a built in input device. Mobile Kiosk is setup so that once you add the webpage to your tablet’s home screen, it’ll look and feel like a real application and not a webpage. It also allows the user to navigate the slides by swiping, and can be configured to integrate with Mailchimp, using it as a lead capture point as well.

**Using on a TV**
While tablets give a great cozy display, make your message bold by displaying it on a big screen TV. Mobile Kiosk adds a “full screen” button to hide the web browser buttons and UI, perfect for displaying on a wall or hanging in a window for dynamic signage.


== Installation ==
Install this application either through the WP Admin interface or uploading the plugin to your wp-content/plugins folder. After installation, two new post types will be added: Kiosk Gallery and Kiosk Slides. Add a new Kiosk Gallery, which contains the slides within a single gallery. From there, you can create new slides, edit slides, remove slides, and reorder them from within the Kiosk Gallery editor. You only need to touch the Kiosk Slides menu if you truly want to delete a slide from the site.
